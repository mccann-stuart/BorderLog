## 2025-03-08 - UI Error Information Disclosure
**Vulnerability:** Displaying `error.localizedDescription` directly in the UI in `Learn/CalendarTabView.swift`.
**Learning:** Raw framework error descriptions can leak sensitive implementation details or system states to users.
**Prevention:** Catch errors, log them securely using `os.Logger` with `privacy: .private`, and display generic, safe error messages (like "Failed to load data. Please try again.") to the user.

## 2026-03-24 - Biometric Authentication Passcode Fallback
**Vulnerability:** Implementing custom fallback logic when `context.canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, ...)` fails can still permanently lock out users if `canEvaluatePolicy` succeeds but `evaluatePolicy` fails (e.g. broken FaceID sensor or repeated face mismatches without fallback to passcode).
**Learning:** `LAContext` native `.deviceOwnerAuthentication` policy securely and automatically handles falling back to device passcode when biometric authentication is unavailable or fails. The passcode remains a valid root of trust on the device.
**Prevention:** Always use `.deviceOwnerAuthentication` instead of `.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` as the primary authentication policy when requiring user verification to unlock sensitive data in iOS apps, to ensure a seamless and reliable fallback to passcode.

## 2026-03-24 - Dead Code Authentication Bypass
**Vulnerability:** A temporary debug toggle (`isAppleSignInEnabled = false`) was left in the codebase which exposed a conditional path allowing mock user UUID generation and bypassing authentications checks completely.
**Learning:** Hardcoding application bypasses—even temporary ones for local-only testing—as feature flags directly into production source structures leaves a permanent backdoor that can be triggered accidentally via a single line change.
**Prevention:** Never commit local-only authentication bypasses or mock toggles. If tests need mock user data, handle injection via standard DI practices rather than allowing production views to generate mock IDs.
